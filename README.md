Cloud Threat Detection 

Visualization drawn in excalidraw (https://excalidraw.com/). Sharing in the event anyone wanted to build upon it or expand the concept of what they're currently doing in the cloud threat detection space. Goal was to conceptualize the attack surfaces in the cloud and theory craft the types of detections that can be applied to each one.

Caveats:
- Not meant to be all-inclusive of every type of detection
- Lots of ambiguity
- Not a data science wizard
